#home_automation this project includes the working program files to operate on home controlled system created by co-workers using aurdino system
we have our main file which is going to run all the modules namely 1. SmartApi 2. Facial 3. Sentiment Analysis , all these three will be combined to work in home automation , a small prototype of IOT that is already implemented during the period of intern.

These three module are to be implemented in a robot . 

The basic workflow of the module is such :

The program starts with a "key-word" and camera present in the robot person before the robot is identified (by its name if previous data is supplied ) or classified as stranger . If person is authorized then it can further command the robot for accessing the home appliances or devices such as light , fan , A.C. , alarm in the phone etc ( all those devices which are connected through our server ) .

Moving further we have our robot with talkback feature with a set of near about 100 question and answer of usual needs , also it can recognizes 7 sentiments of the authorized person , which include angry , sad , happy , disgusted , nuetral , feared , surprised and we can play music for the user as per its mood , from either our local server or online.
